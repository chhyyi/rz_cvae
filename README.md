# About this notebook
__Redzone CVAE With Label__
It was part of [my github repo aiffelthon](https://www.github.io/chhyyi/aiffelthon) as cvae\_poc but splitted to easily distribute to team.  
So same as before, it is modified from clone of [elemisi's CVAE github repo](https://www.github.io/elemisi/ConditionalVAE).
